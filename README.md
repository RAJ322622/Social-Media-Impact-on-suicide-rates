Social media Impact on suicide rate
____________________________________________________________

The increasing use of social media has sparked concerns over its impact on mental health and rising suicide rates, especially among young people. Studies indicate that constant exposure to curated, often idealized content can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, depression, and anxiety. Social media platforms, while providing connection and community, also foster cyberbullying, harassment, and unhealthy comparisons, which can severely impact self-esteem and well-being.

Particularly troubling is the trend of youth engaging in harmful behaviors influenced by viral challenges, harmful trends, or negative peer interactions. Cyberbullying, now more prevalent than ever, has become a major factor associated with social media-related suicides, as victims often feel isolated and helpless. Additionally, the "highlight reel" effect on platforms amplifies the gap between real life and online portrayals, creating unrealistic standards.

Several mental health organizations and experts are calling for stricter regulations on social media platforms, emphasizing the need for content moderation, mental health resources, and protective features. Schools and parents are encouraged to foster open discussions about social mediaâ€™s effects, equipping young people with tools to navigate its challenges responsibly.
